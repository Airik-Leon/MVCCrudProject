# MVC CRUD Project
## Author: Airik Leon
### Date: November 2017

This project is a blog that is (still in development) and is intended to show off Spring skills and provide a blog for my projects, articles, and photography portfolio.

technologies used:
Spring, Java, Jstl EL, Gradle.
txt files (for now).

Future things I would like to add are the following:
 - Users make changes to their accounts.
 - change the mock posts to proper category posts
 - Add more admin see stats.
 - customize feeds for users.

My biggest problem were the following:
- Handling user errors that would crash the program
- Handling multiple users
